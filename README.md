# Leaky Cauldron

A web application to create a psuedo CSS template file.

## Use
Upload the two banners into the application.  The application will automatically filter with banner goes to which html template display.  

From there, a form will appear asking for which colors you want to use for which features on the template.  Once the form is done, then generate the CSS file.  The generated CSS file will appear in a text box.
