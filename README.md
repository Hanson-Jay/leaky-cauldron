# Leaky Cauldron

A web application to create a psuedo CSS template file according to BYU-Idaho online web page standard.

## Use
Upload the two banners into the application.  The application will automatically filter with banner goes to which html template display.  

From there, a form will appear asking for which colors you want to use for which features on the template.  To choose colors you can either use the suggested dominant colors or slightly alter it by the color picker on the screen.  Once the form is done, then click "See CSS" to download or copy and paste the file.  Additionally you can download the other html and js files BYU-Idaho standard.  The generated CSS file will appear in a text box.
